# CPPWork

This is a culmination of any side C++ work I've done over the years.

Each folder, excluding Misc, is a book I've read and done the extra programming projects to.
Some are very trivial, geared more towards the very basics of C++, but I still did a lot of them to make sure I don't miss anything.

The two books referenced are:
Absolute C++ (6th Edition) by Walter Savitch
C++ From Control Structures through Objects (8th Edition) by Tony Gaddis
